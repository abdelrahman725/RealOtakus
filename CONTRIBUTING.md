 - **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)** for styling


# Getting Started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.

**Note** you have to setup both frontend and backend if you are going to work on only one of them or both.
## BackEnd Setup
4. Navigate to `backend` directory.
5. Create and activate your python virutal environment in your `backend` directory

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv && source env/bin/activate
    ```

6. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. create a file called `.env.local` in your `backend` directory and add the following :
    
    ```
    DEBUG="True"
    SECRET_KEY="django-insecure-z%33@q!hg%d0cr=*t&36heh3urg2ilru&zb47uq@!i4f#5%exa"
    DOMAIN="127.0.0.1:3000"
    ALLOWED_HOSTS="127.0.0.1,localhost"
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://127.0.0.1:3000"
    ADMIN_PATH="admin/"
    ```
    
8.  Migrate your database:

    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
    ```
9.  Start the Django development server

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
The Backend setup should be done by now !

## FrontEnd Setup
10.  Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

11.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.


12. Install JavaScript dependencies using npm
    ```
    npm install
    ```

13. create a file called `.env.local` in your `frontend` directory and add the following :
    
    ```
    # django host
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8000 

    # Next.js
    NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
    ```

14. Install [Live Sass Compiler](vscode:extension/glenn2223.live-sass) for auto compiled css code, or alternatively you can install Sass in your machine to compile and watch [App.scss](frontend/styles/App.scss) file [see how](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#preprocessing).

15. Start the Next.js development server
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

16. Access the Next.js app at http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your web browser.

**All Setup and Now It's time for coding ðŸ˜‰**
